<h1>About This TIL Tracker</h1>

<p>
  This application is a simple "Today I Learned" (TIL) tracker, built as part of my application for the
  <strong>Junior Rails Programmer</strong> role at 37signals.
</p>

<p>
  Its primary purpose is to demonstrate practical skills in Ruby on Rails development, following the principles
  and practices valued by 37signals. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Standard Rails:</strong> Built on Ruby on Rails 7+, adhering to conventions and keeping things simple.</li>
  <li><strong>Hotwire for Interactivity:</strong> Features like tag filtering rely on Turbo Frames for efficient updates without complex JavaScript.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand-crafted CSS:</strong> All styling is done with plain, semantic CSS, avoiding frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. The focus is on clarity and usability.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The application avoids unnecessary layers or dependencies, focusing on core functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Log new learnings with a title, detailed body, and relevant tags.</li>
  <li>Assign a specific date to each learning, allowing for retroactive logging.</li>
  <li>View all learnings, sorted by the date learned.</li>
  <li>Edit existing learnings.</li>
  <li>Filter learnings by clicking on tags.</li>
  <li>Select and delete multiple learnings at once.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  It is my first Rails application. Partly, I built it to learn Rails, but also to have a simple tool to log my learnings and share them with you. This app represents an effort to build a useful tool while showcasing craftsmanship and a thoughtful approach to web development.
</p>
<p>
  The development process itself, including challenges faced and decisions made, is documented separately. The <a href="https://github.com/danieldanilov/til_tracker">github repository is here</a>. The app runs on <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The learnings are real: they were tracked separately in a markdown file, which were later uploaded to the app via <a href="https://github.com/danieldanilov/til_tracker/blob/main/db/seeds.rb">seeds.rb</a>. This also ensures that the learnings are retroactively logged and that you are able to view them in the order they were learned.
