  <h1>Hire Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Daniel Danilov, and I'm excited to apply for the Junior Rails Programmer position at 37signals. Having followed the company's philosophy and products (Basecamp, HEY) for years, I deeply admire the focus on simplicity, clarity, and sustainable work practices. Building this very TIL Tracker application using Rails and adhering to the 37signals way (hand-crafted CSS, Hotwire, minimal gems) is my way of demonstrating not just my technical skills, but also my alignment with your values.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Me?</h2>
  <p>
    My journey into development hasn't been entirely conventional. While my professional background is in customer support and data analysis at Automatticâ€”where I honed skills in SQL, Python, communication, and problem-solving, my professional Ruby and Rails experience is limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's precisely why I built this TIL Tracker. When I saw the Junior Rails Programmer opening, I knew I had to demonstrate my potential directly. I had about two weeks, juggling a full-time job and family commitments (during Passover week!), to learn Rails from scratch and build something meaningful that reflected 37signals' principles. This app is the result: a testament to my ability to learn rapidly, solve problems under pressure, and apply new concepts effectively. It showed me the structure of a Rails app, the importance of documentation (like PLANNING.md, LEARNING.md, and TASK.md in this project), and how quickly I can become productive, especially leveraging AI tools to accelerate learning beyond traditional courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I'm new to Rails professionally, I bring strong, transferable analytical skills, a proven track record of clear technical writing and communication (see my <a href="/writing-samples">writing samples</a>), and intense motivation.
  </p>

  <h2>Why 37signals?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm not looking for just any programming job. I'm specifically drawn to 37signals because of the emphasis on craftsmanship, mentorship over management, and building useful, lasting products. I'm specifically seeking an opportunity to learn and grow within a company whose values and leadership I genuinely admire. The idea of working on a small, talented team, learning from senior developers, and contributing meaningfully to products like Basecamp and HEY is incredibly appealing. I thrive in environments that value autonomy and clear thinking, and I believe my background in data analysis and technical writing provides a unique perspective that complements a product development team.
  </p>
  <p>
    This TIL Tracker itself serves as a testament to my learning process and my ability to quickly pick up and apply new concepts in the Rails ecosystem, following the specific constraints and philosophies outlined by 37signals.
