## ðŸ’¡ Discovered During Work
*(Add any new tasks, questions, or blockers that arise here)*
- Shell environment inconsistencies require using `rbenv exec` before Rails/Bundler commands for reliability. Added note to `TASK.md` and command list in `PLANNING.md`.
- Rails generator failed for model name `Til` due to potential conflict. Switched to `Learning` model and `LearningsController`. Need to clean up leftover `Til` files. (Added Apr 8, 2024)
- Add task: Clean up generated files related to `Til` model/controller. (Added Apr 8, 2024)
